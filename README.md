# calculadora_imc

My second Flutter project.

This simple app is for calculate the body mass index (IMC in portuguese) and learn more about Flutter.
And is my second app made with Flutter.
I've used the same widgets as the [previous one](https://github.com/henriqueparaguassu/contador_de_pessoas) and more: Scroolview, Scaffold, Appbar, Form, TextFormField and features like Controllers, GlobalKey, Validation, etc.
